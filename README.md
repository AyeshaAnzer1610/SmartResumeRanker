# üíº Smart Resume Ranker

A powerful AI-powered resume ranking application that uses both traditional keyword matching (TF-IDF) and advanced semantic matching (BERT) to rank resumes against job descriptions.

## üöÄ Features

### üìÑ **Multi-Format Support**
- **PDF Resume Support**: Upload `.pdf` files alongside `.docx`
- **Word Document Support**: Upload `.docx` files
- **Automatic Text Extraction**: Handles complex formatting and layouts

### üß† **Dual Matching Algorithms**

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip package manager

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartResumeRanker.git
   cd SmartResumeRanker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`
   - The app will automatically open in your default browser

## üìã Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following dependencies:

```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0
scikit-learn>=1.1.0
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
python-docx>=0.8.11
docx2txt>=0.8
pdfplumber>=0.7.0
```

## üéØ How to Use

### 1. **Enter Job Description**
- Paste the complete job description in the text area
- The more detailed the description, the better the matching

### 2. **Upload Resumes**
- Click "Browse files" to upload resume files
- Supported formats: `.pdf` and `.docx`
- You can upload multiple files at once

### 3. **Choose Matching Method**
- **BERT Semantic Matching**: For understanding meaning and context
- **TF-IDF Keyword Matching**: For exact keyword matching

### 4. **Analyze Results**
- View ranked results with match scores
- Click on each result to see detailed analysis
- Download results as CSV for further use

## üß™ Testing with Sample Data

The project includes sample data for testing:

- `sample_jd.txt`: Machine Learning Engineer job description
- `strong_match_resume.txt`: Strong ML Engineer candidate
- `weak_match_resume.txt`: Marketing Specialist (weak match)
- `medium_match_resume.txt`: Software Developer (medium match)

To test:
1. Copy the content from `sample_jd.txt` into the job description field
2. Upload the resume files
3. Compare results between TF-IDF and BERT methods

## üî¨ Technical Details

### **BERT Semantic Matching**
- Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (fast and efficient)
- Converts text to high-dimensional embeddings
- Calculates cosine similarity between job description and resumes
- Understands semantic relationships and synonyms

### **TF-IDF Keyword Matching**
- Extracts and weights important terms
- Uses cosine similarity for ranking
- Fast processing for large datasets
- Good for exact technical term matching

### **Text Processing**
- Automatic text extraction from PDF and DOCX files
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Stop word removal
- Case-insensitive matching

## üìà Performance Comparison

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| **BERT** | Slower | Higher | Complex job descriptions, semantic understanding |
| **TF-IDF** | Faster | Lower | Quick screening, exact keyword matching |
